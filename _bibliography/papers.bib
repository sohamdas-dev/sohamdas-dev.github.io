  abstract={In this paper we show that MAC is approximately submodular, hence a greedy approach to selecting control agents guarantees fractionally sub-optimal solutions for the line network. Moreover, we provide a special scenario for bipartite graphs that shows that the violation of submodularity can be arbitrarily bad, highlighting limitations of our provided guarantees in such worst case situations, thereby indicating that greedy approaches may not be always desirable in attaining anti-coordination. We further provide encouraging computational results which strongly suggest the effectiveness of greedy selection in practical scenarios.}

  abstract={We consider the control of decentralized learning dynamics for agents in an anti-coordination network game. In the anti-coordination network game, there is a preferred action in the absence of neighbors' actions, and the utility an agent receives from the preferred action decreases as more of its neighbors select the preferred action, potentially causing the agent to select a less desirable action. The decentralized dynamics that is based on the synchronous best-response dynamics converge for the considered payoffs. Given a convergent action profile, we measure anti-coordination by the number of edges in the underlying graph that have at least one agent in either end of the edge not taking the preferred action. A designer wants to find an optimal set of agents to control under a finite budget in order to achieve maximum anti-coordination (MAC) on game convergence as a result of the dynamics. We show that the MAC is submodular in expectation over all realizations of the payoff interaction constants in bipartite networks. The proof relies on characterizing well-behavedness of  MAC instances for bipartite networks, and designing a coupling between the dynamics and another distribution preserving selection protocol, for which we can show the diminishing returns property. Utilizing this result, we obtain a performance guarantee for the greedy optimization of MAC. Finally, we provide a computational study to show the effectiveness of greedy node selection strategies to solve MAC on general bipartite networks.}

  abstract={Many industrial components, especially those realized through 3D printing undergo surface finishing processes, predominantly, in the form of mechanical polishing. The polishing processes for custom components remain manual and iterative. Determination of the polishing endpoints, i.e., when to stop the process to achieve a desired surface finish, remains a major obstacle to process automation and in the cost-effective custom/3D printing process chains. With the motivation to automate the polishing process of 3D printed materials to a desired level of surface smoothness, we propose a dynamic model of surface morphology evolution of 3D printed materials during a polishing process. The dynamic model can account for both material removal and redistribution during the polishing process. In addition, the model accounts for increased material flow due to heat generated during the polishing process. We also provide an initial random surface model that matches the initial surface statistics. We propose an optimization problem for model parameter estimation based on empirical data using KL-divergence and surface roughness as two metrics of the objective. We validate the proposed model using data from polishing of a 3D printed sample. The procedures developed makes the model applicable to other 3D printed materials and polishing processes. We obtain a network formation model as a representation of the surface evolution from the heights and radii of asperities. We use the network connectivity (Fiedler number) as a metric for surface smoothness that can be used to determine whether a desired level of smoothness is reached or not.}

  abstract={We develop a best-response algorithm for solving constrained Markov games assuming limited violations for the potential game property. The limited violations of the potential game property mean that changes in value function due to unilateral policy alterations can be measured by the potential function up to an error α . We show the existence of stationary ϵ -approximate constrained Nash policy whenever the set of feasible stationary policies is non-empty. Our setting has agents accessing an efficient probably approximately correct solver for a constrained Markov decision process which they use for generating best-response policies against the other agents’ former policies. For an accuracy threshold ϵ>4α , the best-response dynamics generate provable convergence to ϵ -Nash policy in finite time with probability at least 1−δ at the expense of polynomial bounds on sample complexity that scales with the reciprocal of ϵ and δ .}
