<p>Welcome! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/industrial/index.html">ISEN</a> department at Texas A&amp;M University, advised by <a href="https://netmas.engr.tamu.edu/people/ceyhun-eksin/">Prof. Ceyhun Eksin</a>. 
My research interests are situated at the intersection of game theory, optimization, and reinforcement learning. Topics of interest include intervention design in network games, decentralized learning in Markov games, combinatorial optimization, with applications in social network analysis, epidemic modelling, and safe multiagent reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>Please find my academic <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_HCsmwvltMVZ-OGhEd8D21tD04m3DctX/view?usp=sharing">CV here</a>.

<p>Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://ise.utk.edu/">Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering</a> at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where I lead the <span style="color: #007bff; font-weight: bold;">Multiagent Systems and Complexity Group</span>. My appointment is part of the <a href="https://research.utk.edu/cluster-hire/science-informed-artificial-intelligence/">Science-Informed Artificial Intelligence cluster</a> at Tennessee, a strategic initiative at the intersection of AI and the domain sciences. I received my Ph.D. in Operations Research from Texas A&M University in 2025, where I was advised by <a href="https://netmas.engr.tamu.edu/people/ceyhun-eksin/">Ceyhun Eksin</a>.</p>

<p>My research sits at the interface of game theory, optimization, and reinforcement learning, with a focus on multiagent decision making in complex environments. I address challenges in designing safe and efficient learning algorithms for agents operating in dynamic systems, such as energy grids, social or economic systems, where strategic interactions, uncertainity and constraints are prevalent. Research themes include learning and intervention design in network games, safe-learning in Markov games, combinatorial optimization, with applications in network science, epidemics and multiagent reinforcement learning.</p>
