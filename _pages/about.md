Welcome! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the [ISEN](https://engineering.tamu.edu/industrial/index.html) department at Texas A&M University, advised by [Prof. Ceyhun Eksin.](https://netmas.engr.tamu.edu/people/ceyhun-eksin/) My research interests are situated at the intersection of game theory, optimization and reinforcement learning. Topics of interest include intervention design in network games, decentralized learning in Markov games, combinatorial optimization, with applications in social network analysis, epidemic modelling and safe multi-agent reinforcement learning. 

Please find my academic [CV here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_HCsmwvltMVZ-OGhEd8D21tD04m3DctX/view?usp=sharing) For an updated list of publications, please see my [Google Scholar.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EeyWLicAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) Here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soham-das-196075125/) account. I can be reached at firstname(dot)lastname(at)tamu(dot)edu.
