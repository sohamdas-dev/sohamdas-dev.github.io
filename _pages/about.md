Hi! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the [ISEN](https://engineering.tamu.edu/industrial/index.html) department at Texas A&M University, advised by [Prof. Ceyhun Eksin.](https://netmas.engr.tamu.edu/people/ceyhun-eksin/) My interests are situated at the intersection of game theory, optimization and reinforcement learning. Topics of interest include intervention design in network games, decentralized learning in Markov games, dynamical processes on graphs, with applications in social network analysis, epidemic modelling and safe multi-agent reinforcement learning. Please find my [CV here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_HCsmwvltMVZ-OGhEd8D21tD04m3DctX/view?usp=sharing)
