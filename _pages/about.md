Hi! I am a Ph.D student in Operations Research at Texas A&M University, advised by [Prof. Ceyhun Eksin.](https://netmas.engr.tamu.edu/people/ceyhun-eksin/) My research interests are situated at the intersection of  game theory and optimization. Topics of interest include intervention design in network games, learning in stochastic games, dynamical processes on graphs with applications in social network analysis, epidemic modelling and safe multi-agent reinforcement learning. 
# Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
