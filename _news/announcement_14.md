Honored to share that my paper, [*Learning Nash in Constrained Markov Games with an Alpha-Potential*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10531766), won the **Outstanding Student Paper Prize** from the [Technical Committee on Networked Systems](https://ieeecss.org/technical-committee/networks-and-communications), IEEE Control Systems Society!

Many thanks to my collaborators, mentors, and the research community for their support.
