Delighted to host Prof. Manxi Wu from UC Berkeley for the ISE Department Seminar Series! She delivered an insightful talk on [*Equilibrium Selection and Decentralized Learning in General-Sum Games*](https://calendar.utk.edu/event/ise-graduate-seminar-1886). Grateful for the inspiring exchange of ideas that followed.
